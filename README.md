This repository is contains a script which will pull all of the lists that I use 
for my personal [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net) and consolidate them into a single 
list.  
This means that my Pi-Hole only pulls a single list whenever it updates instead of
around 60.

The `blocklist` branch contains the consolidated 'master' `blocklist` file in the Pihole Domains format.  
The `blocklist` branch also contains a `mirror` directory - this directory contains all of the individual blocklists downloaded in their original format.
