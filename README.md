This repository is contains a script which will pull all of the lists that I use 
for my personal [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net) and consolidate them into a single 
mirror.  
This means that my Pi-Hole only pulls all of its lists from Github instead of all over.  

To use this, copy and paste the contents of [adlists.list](adlists.list) onto your Pi-Hole Blocklists.
